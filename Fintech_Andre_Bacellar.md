* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Since the competition is offering similar solutions more that would be a diffenrentiator for the users to keep nvesting with them and not the other adn also it would put the retail investor at the same level as professional investors.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Big data, NLP and machine learning to automate to consolidate all the informaiton with the minimum cost

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

The bloomberg like terminals offer a lof of data at real time speed and for that big data is mandatory to organize the information in a comprehensive and fast way and machine learning to offer insights and to automate most of the tasks.
